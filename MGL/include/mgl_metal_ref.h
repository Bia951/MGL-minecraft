/*
 * mgl_metal_ref.h
 * MGL
 *
 * Metal Object Lifecycle Subsystem.
 *
 * Unified release helpers for Metal objects stored as `void *` (ARC-bridged)
 * in C structs (Texture::mtl_data, Buffer::data.mtl_data, Shader::mtl_data.*,
 * Sampler::mtl_data, Program::mtl_data, Spirv::mtl_function / mtl_library,
 * Sync::mtl_event / mtl_command_buffer, etc.).
 *
 * Problem (PLAN.md Phase 1E): the codebase had three parallel release paths:
 *   1. ctx->mtl_funcs.mtlDeleteMTLObj(ctx, ptr)  — C files (22 call sites)
 *   2. CFBridgingRelease(ptr); ptr = NULL;        — MGLRenderer.m (24 sites)
 *   3. CFRelease(ptr); ptr = NULL;                — program.c Spirv + 3-way
 *                                                   if/else fallbacks (9 sites)
 * All three ultimately do the same CFBridgingRelease.  The function-pointer
 * indirection in path 1 exists only because C files cannot message ObjC
 * objects directly; internally it just calls CFBridgingRelease.
 *
 * Solution: a single `static inline` helper that takes `void **slot`, calls
 * CFBridgingRelease, and nulls the slot.  This:
 *   - Eliminates the forgotten-`= NULL` class of bugs (22 sites were missing it)
 *   - Removes the dead `else CFRelease` fallback branches (3 sites)
 *   - Unifies program.c's raw CFRelease on Spirv fields (4 sites)
 *   - Is a pure C function (no ObjC messaging), so it works in both .c and .m TUs
 *
 * Scope: this header ONLY covers the generic `void *` slot pattern.
 * Sync objects keep their own `mtlReleaseSync` path (needs @try/@catch for
 * legacy MTLSharedEvent robustness).  Context teardown of `mtlView` /
 * `mtlObj` (the renderer itself) stays in glm_context.c (those are assigned
 * via CFBridgingRetain of ObjC objects, not Metal objects per se).
 *
 * Dependencies: CoreFoundation (CFBridgingRelease) + stddef.h (NULL).
 * No Metal framework dependency — works in pure C TUs.
